# SwiftStarterProjects
This repository showcases all the projects I have built in Swift while I was still learning the different
features of Swift programming language. Anybody who is interested to learn swift would be benefitted from this repository as well. Feel free to contact me at aariz.ice@gmail.com if you have any question about the code.  


1. Project-1: [1-Counter](https://github.com/MasterSA/SwiftStarterProjects/tree/master/1-Counter) This is a simple project where you would see two buttons: increment and decrement, and one label for showing the counter result. Whenever you will click on Increment button, counter will be increased by 1 and whenever you click the decrease button, counter will be decreased by one.
